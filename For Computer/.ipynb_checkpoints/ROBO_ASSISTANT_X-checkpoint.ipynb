The concepts behind GPS positioning are very simple, but the application and implementation require amazing precision. GPS positioning works on two basic mathematical concepts. The first is called trilateration, which literally means positioning from three distances. The second concept is the relationship between distance traveled, rate (speed) of travel and amount of time spent traveling, or, distance is rate multiplied by time. The GPS satellites are constantly broadcasting their location to the Earth. The GPS receiver on your mobile phone or GPS receiver on your car uses this information\",\n",

Time is determined by how long it takes for a signal to travel from the GPS satellite to a GPS receiver on earth. With a known rate and a known time we can solve for the distance between satellite and receiver. Once we have the distance from at least 3 satellites, we can determine a 3 dimensional position on the surface of the earth.\"\n",
